## Set Up Question Streams

A question stream

## Can the study file be updated after some participants have already logged in?

When the participant logs in in Well Ping, they downloads your study file and stores it locally. At every subsequent launch of the app, Well Ping will fetch the study file again from your server in the background and use the newly downloaded study file at the next launch.

As such, it is possible to update the study file even when some participants have already logged in. They will be using the new study file at the second launch of Well Ping after the study file update. However, we only recommend updaing study files to fix smaller issues such as typos, and not to change larger components such as streams as larger changes might create unpredictable problems.
