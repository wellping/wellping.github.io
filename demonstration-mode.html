        functionality.
      </h3>

      <p>
        Normally, since Well Ping aims to help research team collect
        <strong>ecological momentary assessments (EMA)</strong> data, the user
        will only be able to fill out a “ping” (i.e., a survey) in a limited
        time window following a local notification. For example, a study file
        may be set so that the user may receive a notification at 8AM, 10AM,
        2PM, and 4PM, and will have the 8-9AM, 10AM-11AM, 2PM-3PM, and 4PM-5PM
        one-hour window to fill our the ping respectively. This in turn means
        that the app will not provide any functionality outside these windows.
      </p>

        However, to demonstrate Well Ping’s full features and functionality,
        this specific study file is set so that you will receive a ping at every
        hour’s first minute (e.g., 9:01AM). Each ping will expire after 59
        minutes (e.g., 10:00AM). This way you will be able to start a new survey
        every hour to assess the app.
